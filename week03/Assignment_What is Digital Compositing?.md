__Composite__ is the manipulated combination of at least two source images to produce an integrated result.

So __Digital compositing__ is the process of digitally assembling multiple images to make a final image, typically for print, motion pictures or screen display. It is 
the digital analogue of optical film compositing.

#### Digital Compositing Tools


* Paint Programs

* Color Correction utilities

* Warping/Morphing Tools

* Matte-Extraction software

* General-purpose compositing packages




#### Basic Terms

This composite was created from a multitude of different original images. We usually refer to the individual pieces from which we create our final composite as 'Elements'. 

Different people, countries and software packages do not always use the same names to refer to certain tools, operators, or subjects. In addition, due to the need to simplify certain things, just about every statement we make could probably be countered with some exception to the rule.

* A matte painting is a painted representation of a landscape, set, or distant location that allows filmmakers to create the illusion of an environment that is not present at the filming location. Historically, matte painters and film technicians have used various techniques to combine a matte-painted image with live-action footage. At its best, depending on the skill levels of the artists and technicians, the effect is "seamless" and creates environments that would otherwise be impossible or expensive to film. In the scenes the painting part is static and movements are integrated on it.
