Digital compositing is the process of digitally assembling multiple images to make a final image, typically for print, motion pictures or screen display. It is 
the digital analogue of optical film compositing.

Digital Compositing Tools
Some of the software tools we'll be discussing include:
Paint Programs
Color Correction utilities
Warping/Morphing Tools
Matte-Extraction software
General-purpose compositing packages
But we'll also be discussing (particularly during the 2nd half of this course), some of the things that should be done before, during and after the creation of the original elements to ensure that they are as useful as possible.

Basic Terms
This composite was created from a multitude of different original images. We usually refer to the individual pieces from which we create our final composite as 'Elements'. Elements in this composite include:

Disclaimer:
Different people, countries and software packages do not always use the same names to refer to certain tools, operators, or subjects. In addition, due to the need to simplify certain things, just about every statement we make could probably be countered with some exception to the rule.

This Term hostorically applied to video systems.
In a video mixer a Keyer can turn off a color value making it transparent.
